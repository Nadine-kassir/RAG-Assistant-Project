 Breast Cancer Chatbot - RAG Project
📘 Project Overview

This project is a Breast Cancer Chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
The chatbot allows users to ask questions about breast cancer and receive accurate, context-aware responses based on trusted medical literature, including PDF articles from PubMed.

The project is designed to grow over time — new PDF documents or research articles can be added to improve the knowledge base, making the chatbot more robust and up-to-date.
